description: >-
  Fannie Mae, officially known as the Federal National Mortgage Association, is
  a government-sponsored enterprise that plays a critical role in the American
  housing market. Established in 1938, Fannie Mae operates as a secondary
  mortgage lender, purchasing mortgages from banks and other financial
  institutions. By buying these loans, Fannie Mae helps to provide liquidity to
  the mortgage market, enabling banks to lend more money to homebuyers.
  Additionally, Fannie Mae helps to stabilize the housing market by providing
  financial stability and preventing sharp fluctuations in mortgage interest
  rates. Through its efforts, Fannie Mae helps to make homeownership more
  accessible and affordable for millions of Americans.
